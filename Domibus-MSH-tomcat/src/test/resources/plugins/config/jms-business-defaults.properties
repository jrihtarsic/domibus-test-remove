# This file contains all default values for your business processes. If you submit a message to the JMS backend with
# unset properties those will be filled in from here. I.e.

# FromPartyId       =MyCompany
# FromPartyIdType   =urn:oasis:names:tc:ebcore:partyid-type:iso6523:0088
# FromPartyRole     =Buyer
# ToPartyId         =OtherCompany
# ToPartyIdType     =urn:oasis:names:tc:ebcore:partyid-type:iso6523:0088
# ToPartyRole       =Seller
#
# would allow to send requests from your company as buyer to OtherCompany as seller without having to qualify those
# properties on each message. If those values are also available in the submitted message those will be used.
