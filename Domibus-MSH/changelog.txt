Domibus 4.0
- Default WS Plugin: the XSD schema validation has been disabled by default due to performance reasons
- Removed unused classes:Validator<T>,NullValidator,ValidationException
- Support for email alert system
- Support for multi-tenancy
- Sample domain configuration file domain_name-domibus.properties included in the distribution.

- Fix sendAttempt counter (initial one plus number of retries defined in the pmode)
- Block the receiving of the message in case the sender's certificate is not valid or revoked.
    Two more properties were added (for more details check domibus.properties file):

- JMS monitoring: extended the functionality for clustered installations.
- Core: listPendingMessages and download operations behave correctly in case of a clustered installation.
- Core: Spring services are always executing within a transaction even if there is no specific @Transactional annotation present
- Core: Quartz integration with managed threads in WebLogic and WildFly
- Core: during sendMessage operation, Domibus verifies that the parties roles are allowed (present in PMode) and different among them.

- Core: during MSH receive operation, Domibus can verify the trust of the sender if activated.
- Core: validation on MessageId and RefToMessageId can be by-passed by removing the key "domibus.sendMessage.messageIdPattern" from configuration file.
