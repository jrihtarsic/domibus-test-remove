Domibus 3.3-RC1
- Migrated the logging framework to SLF4J and Logback
- Domibus uses 3 logs files: domibus.log, domibus-business.log and domibus.security.log
- Fixed the search of the JMS messages for WebLogic(for JMS messages having property with null values) and Tomcat(for JMS messages with no "Text" property)
- Spring services are always executing within a transaction even if there is no specific @Transactional annotation present
- Quartz integration with managed threads in WebLogic and WildFly
- During submit operation, Domibus verifies that the message is being sent by the same party as the one configured as the sending access point.
- During MSH dispatch, Domibus verifies the validity of sender's certificate.
- During MSH receive, Domibus verifies the trust of the sender.
- Domibus MSH sendMessage would trim the leading and trailing whitespaces in all the request fields.
- Domibus MSH sendMessage verifies that - if MessageId and RefToMessageId is specified by backend client, then it should contain only printable ASCII characters.
- Validation on MessageId and RefToMessageId can be bypassed by removing the key "domibus.sendMessage.messageIdPattern" from configuration file.
- MySQL installation of Domibus database is set to have collation of 'UTF8_BIN' to make DB level string comparison (in SQLs) case sensitive. This will enable support for case sensitive message ids.
