        o domibus.sender.certificate.validation.onreceiving=true

- JMS monitoring: extended the functionality for clustered installations.
- Core: listPendingMessages and download operations behave correctly in case of a clustered installation.
- Core: Spring services are always executing within a transaction even if there is no specific @Transactional annotation present

- Core: during MSH receive operation, Domibus can verify the trust of the sender if activated.
- Core: validation on MessageId and RefToMessageId can be by-passed by removing the key "domibus.sendMessage.messageIdPattern" from configuration file.
