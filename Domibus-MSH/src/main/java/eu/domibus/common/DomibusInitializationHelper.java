 * This class ensure that the system is ready to start sending and receiving.
 * Indeed in PolicyBuilderImpl you can see that the constructor is instantiating the factory to null, then call
 * the setBus method which will set the factory (protected member of superclass). If messages are received between
 * the two operations, a nullpointer is triggered. This class ensure that the system is properly initialize before sending
 * or receiving messages.
